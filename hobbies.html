    <li><h2>3D art</h2></li>
    <p>I started learning 3D art in Blender when the pandemic hit the world. Ive always been an artistic person, wether its 
        paiting, making digital sutff on my phone or even designing prototypes for web pages. When I discovered that its possible to make
        advanced looking art on free software, it was a no brainer.

        and go to fun events every year.
